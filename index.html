<h2>Asburys in America Book</h2><h3>Compiled by: Carl E. Asbury</h3>

<p>
I became interested in my family ancestors as a relatively young boy.
Discussions with relatives indicated that little seemed to be known about our
ancestors, perhaps 3 or 4 generations back. This gave me a challenge to search
for the unknown. Since there were only a few people by our surname in our area
I thought there were probably not too many in the whole USA. I was of the
opinion if I would write to a few of the Asburys that some one would soon have
the tie-in which I was seeking to show when and which Asburys came to America
from England.
</p>

<p>
After about 40 years of search, and with the help of many interested and
knowledgeable friends; after traveling many miles, visiting many branches of
Asburys; searching in many libraries, many county court house records and
reviewing many years of census records in several states, a rather complicated
network or ' 'Web" of Asburys and Asberrys evolved. The thin thread to my
ancestors appeared. It was also a thrill to see that many of the Asburys were
branches of the same tree. In the beginning I had not realized how interesting
such a search would be. One of the thrills and personal satisfactions of this
hobby is to be Able to help others who are interested in searching out their
ancestors and establish their family tree. The exchange of information is most
satisfying helpful to all.
</p>

<p>
After collecting names other genealogical information over a period of several
years on many branches of Asbury, I feel an obligation to make the information
available to those who are interested. This is especially desirable since many
of the branches into a large tree. Perhaps with further study many of the other
branches will eventually also tie into this same tree.
