<pHeader>ASBURYS IN AMERICA</pHeader>

<p>
One branch Of the Asbury family came to America during the early settlement of the American
Colonies. The Pilgrims came over from England in 1620; the Puritans came in 1630 and the
first Asbury came over between 1661 and 1670 and settled in Maryland. From there they
migrated to about eighteen (18) states by the year 1900. It is there are probably over
5000 Asburys in America today that are descendants of these early migrations from England.
</p>

<p>
Other Asbury families followed in later years and where the information is available these
later families have also been included here.
</p>

<p>
The families have been divided into states where they lived. Some families have lived in
many states and in these situations they are usually placed into states either where they
were born or where some of their family lived. If their family history is available their
moving from one location to another has been included. Family histories are just not available
for many families and therefore could not be included.
</p>

<p>
To find a name in this book use the Index. There are more families and names on the charts,
Part II, than appear in the written material, Part I. Larger page numbers in the Index are
for the Charts, Part II.

<pHeader>COOPERATION AND ENCOURAGEMENT BY OTHERS</pHeader>

<p>
One of the major influences early in my search that, encouraged me to my family tree a hobby
was correspondence with others who were interested in the same hobby their willingness to
cooperate by exchanging information. Many persons have assisted by providing genealogical
information and by preparing, biographical information for their branch of the Asbury family
tree. It is only through such splendid cooperation that the data on so many branches of the
Asbury family tree could be put together .
</p>

<p>
Among those who encouraged and influenced me was Dr. B. C. Holtzclaw, Jr. He also had made
family tree searching one of his hobbies. He has written a book "The Genealogy of the
Holtzclaw Family". Since Dr. Holtzclaw's great-great-great grandmother was Nancy Asbury
who married Judge Robert Newsom of Greene County, Georgia, Dr. Holtzclaw has collected the
names of many Asburys in Virginia, especially those from Westmoreland County, as well as in
Georgia. He mailed me copies of much of his early research information and encouraged me to
carry it further This was the incentive and encouragement that, I needed. Dr. Holtzclaw,
several years later, prepared articles outlining information he had accumulated on the Asburys.
(See Bib. page 192). Correspondence with many other people over the years, as well as my own
research, has confirmed and supplemented much of Dr. Holtzclaw's findings. I am very grateful
for his contributions and encouragement to me.
</p>

<p>
Many others have also given splendid cooperation by submitting substantial amounts of family
data for the book. Among these are Mr. and Mrs. George Washington Asbury, their son, Lyle and
daughter, Grace, of Galesburg, IL; Ray and Louise Asbury of Ionia, MI.; Mrs. M. A. Jamieson
of Montreal, Canada; Mrs. Ernest Asbury, O'Fallon, IL.; Mrs. Wayne Noel, Kingsport, TN. ; Dr.
Eslie Asbury, Cincinnati, OH. ; Dorsey F. Asbury, Cincinnati, OH.; Mrs. Patsy Forrester,
Meridian, MS.; Mrs. Jennie Seitz, Roseburg, OR.; Mrs. William Penn Asbury, Scottsdale, AZ.;
Mr. and Mrs. Louis Asbury, Charlotte, N.C.; Mr. and Mrs. Robert, Asbury, Charlotte, N.C.; Mr.
Harry Asbury's data, Tampa, FL.; Rev. Howard R. Wilkinson, Charlotte, N.C.; Mrs. Martha Pratt,
Jefferson City, MO.; Mrs. Dorothy J. Wilmar, St. Louis. MO.; Miss Carletta Asbury, Jonesboro,

</p>

<p>
Markee, Kalamazoo, MI.; Mrs. Rachel Klenm, Louisville, KY.; Mrs. Carl L. Kenagy, Evansville,
IN.; Mrs. Fannie Henderson, Rockwell City, IA.; Mrs. John Thornton, Blackfoot, ID.; Mrs.
Harvey Asbury, Shelburn, IN.; Mrs. C. Ross Snapp, Whiting, IN.; and Mrs. Joe Steward,
Clarksville, GA. Many of these correspondents are now deceased and we feel certain that
their descendants join me in their appreciation of their helpful contributions to the
history of the Asbury family tree.
</p>

<p>
These and many others have contributed various amounts of data for their family histories,
photographs and charts in the Asbury book. The names of these and many others who contributed
information have been underlined on the lineage charts.
</p>

<p>
Although some data is included in this book on Asburys back to about 1650 (over 300 years)
and much federal census data has been and the results included here for several states, it
is recognized that the lists and charts of Asburys are probably far from being complete.
