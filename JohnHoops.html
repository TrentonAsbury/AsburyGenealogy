  <p>
  John Henry Hoops was one of 15 children born to William M. Hoops and Charlotte Rose Asbury.
  He was born on March 19, 1855 in Tazewell co., VA, probably in the area known as Witten's
  Valley.
  </p>

  <p>
  	As a man he was only 5 feet 3 inches tall, but he was tough, loud, and colorful, and he
      became a widely known farmer in Tazewell County.
  </p>

  <p>
  On June 22, 1901 he watched in horror as his second wife, Traysey Bell and two daughters were
  carried away to their deaths by a sudden flash flood. He delivered his two youngest children,
  3-year-old Myrtle and 4-year-old Robert, to safety by crossing a large tree which neighborhood
  men had felled across the floodwaters. Of his 20 children, five died in accidents while young,
  and a sixth child died of complications following typhoid fever.
  </p>

  <p>
  John was strongly partisan in his political outlook and often resorted to violent means of
  political persuasion, including fists and canes. In these political "debates" he was usually
  outnumbered and often suffered painful losses.
  </p>

  <p>
  In a bloody feud involving three families, his throat was slashed with a stalk knife.
  Bleeding profusely and shouting at the top of his lungs, he was placed on his horse by his
  sons and taken home to recover. The feud was concluded peacefully and without continued malice.
  </p>

  <p>
  One of John's legs had to be amputated following a severe injury he sustained in a logging
  accident. He continued his strenuous life on a wooden leg, assisted by a cane.
  </p>

  <p>
  He worked crops, bred stud horses, raised livestock, and hunted roots on the rocky slopes and
  ridges Of "Pounding Mill Branch" and "Baptist Valley." Throughout his difficult life he earned
  his family's way by honest, hard labor.
  </p>

  <p>
  He was married three times. His first wife was Frances Boling (b. 1857) whom he married on
  April 30, 1874 in Tazewell Co., VA. To them were born nine children. After Frances' death
  in 1893, Traysey Bell McGuire (b. 1867), a widow, became his second wife. They were married
  on Dec. 20, 1894 in Tazewell Co., VA. They had three children before she was drowned in 1901
  in the same flood which claimed the lives of two of his children. His third wife was Sarah
  Frances Burnett, a widow born in 1875. They had eight children, two of whom are living at the
  time of this writing: Bessie Hoops Bandy, b. Nov. 17, 1912, and Charles Ben Hoops, b. May 23,
  1916.
  </p>

  <p>
  John Henry Hoops was a rough-hewn and sometimes severe man, but he was honest, generous,
  and intensely loyal. In his declining years he gently doted upon his grandchildren, popping
  corn for them in his open fireplace, peeling apples for them, and fashioning clever toys for
  then from hickory wood. Our memories of him are rich and warm.
  </p>

  <p>
  He died at his home in Tazewell Co., VA on April 15, 1941. Sarah Frances lived until 1955.
  John is buried near his parents in a rural graveyard near the Clinch River at Maxwell in
  Tazewell Co., VA.
